# My Solutions for Advent of Code 2025

Will keep my solutions (mostly not optimised) updated here :D

Idea is to try out a new language, hopefully rust, but figured it's a nice way to brush my skills in Python as well! So this repo will contain solutions in Python and Rust (later is more hopeful than for sure)
